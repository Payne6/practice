Learning to use Git

I have learned how to track, stage and commit files and changes.

I have created a new directory with an html page in it, as well as the current README document. I will use this html document both to practice using the vim editor, and to practice launching html pages from the terminal.

I have been experimenting with branches: I have created a branch, made an alteration, committed the changes, then switched back to the master branch and created a second new branch in order to make alterations to a different document (this one).

I am now in the process of learning to use github. I have uploaded the practice folder (containing the current README and the html page) to a github repository. I am now going to make an alteration to this document and attempt to upload this alteration to the github repository. 

I have now pushed this altered document to the github repository. I have also deleted an old branch from the practice project. I am now going to push this latest adjustment to the remote repository and then try to make the html page a webpage that can be visited.

I have now renamed the test_doc.html document to index.html, and this has meant that the html document can now be visited. This was done by making the project public and then going to settings and scrolling down to github pages. Whether this means that only one html page can be viewed, or other pages can also be viewed is uncertain. Accordingly, I am going to create a new HTML page, link to it from the main (index) page and see if the new page can be access from the main page,
