Learning to use Git

I have learned how to track, stage and commit files and changes.

I have created a new directory with an html page in it, as well as the current README document. I will use this html document both to practice using the vim editor, and to practice launching html pages from the terminal.

I have been experimenting with branches: I have created a branch, made an alteration, committed the changes, then switched back to the master branch and created a second new branch in order to make alterations to a different document (this one).

I am now in the process of learning to use github. I have uploaded the practice folder (containing the current README and the html page) to a github repository. I am now going to make an alteration to this document and attempt to upload this alteration to the github repository.
