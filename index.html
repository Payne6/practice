	<h1>This is a practice project</h1>
	<h2>In this page, we will learn how to use git, and gain some practice running and editing  html pages from the command line.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Created a new branch called iss1</li>
		<li>Used the checkout command to move the head to iss1</li>
		<li>Made an alteration to a document (this one) and committed the changes</li>
		<li>Navigated back to master branch and created a second new branch (fix)</li>
		<li>Made an alteration to README on fix branch and then committed changes.</li>
		<li>Merged the master and fix branches, deleted the fix branch then changed the checkout back to iss1 branch to continue working on this document.</li>
		<li>Next I will commit these changes, merge the iss1 branch with the master branch and delete the iss1 branch.</li>
		<li><a href="link.html">Link to new page</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having done all of the above, I am now quickly revising it by making the current alteration on a new branch called edit_page, which I will merge with the master branch and then delete.</p>
